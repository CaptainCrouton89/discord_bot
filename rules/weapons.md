# Weapons
Every weapon has a size, attack type, and damage type, which together describe the weapon and its properties. You may choose one weapon to be your primary weapon. This weapon can be drawn and stowed as on object interaction, and does not use up equipment slots. 

## Size
The size of weapon refers to how big and powerful the weapon is. Three sizes exist: Heavy, light, and ultralight or improvised.

## Heavy Weapons
Heavy weapons require two hands, can only be wielded by creatures of size medium or larger, and cannot be easily hidden upon your body. Longbows, long swords, pikes, mauls, and heavy crossbows are examples of heavy weapons. Whenever you use a heavy weapon, add 6 to your attack rolls. Your move speed decreases by 5 feet. Heavy weapons use 10 equipment slots while not equipped.

## Light Weapons
Light weapons are, as their name suggests, light, and are easy to handle and hide. Knives, crossbows, shortswords, and shortbows are all examples of light weapons. Whenever you use a light weapon, add 4 to your attack rolls. Light weapons use 5 equipment slots while not equipped.

## Ultralight and Improvised Weapons
Ultralight weapons are generally not even considered real weapons. Fists, rocks, chairs, and bottles of booze are all ultralight weapons. Ultralight weapons grant no bonus to your attack rolls. Ultralight weapons use 2 equipment slots while not equipped.

# Attack Type
Two types of weapons exist: melee and ranged. Each come with different benefits.

## Melee
Melee weapons are weapons that do not leave involve any part of the weapon leaving your hand. They are generally more powerful than ranged weapons, due to the fact that they have a lot of weight attached to them. Whenever you wield a melee weapon, add 3 to your attack rolls.

## Ranged
Ranged weapons trade damage for being able to inflict injuries from a safer distance away. Light ranged weapons have a range of 30 ft, and heavy ranged weapons have a range of 60 ft. You can attack targets within outside of that range, but have a disadvantage to the attack for every 10 feet beyond the range listed.
Ranged weapons come with drawbacks, however. All ranged weapons require two hands unless specifically noted otherwise, and you cannot choose anything but the defensive stance if you move more than 20 feet on your turn, and cannot move more than 20 feet if you already took a non-defensive stance in an engagement.

# Damage Type
## Bludgeoning
Bludgeoning weapons use raw force to inflict damage, and therefore take the most advantage of high might. Examples of bludgeoning weapons include war hammers and clubs. Whenever you wield a bludgeoning weapon and use the might stance, add 4 to your attack roll.

## Piercing
Piercing weapons use knowledge of your opponents maneuvering to inflict damage, and therefore take the most advantage of high cunning. Examples of piercing weapons include rapiers and weapons that use arrows. Whenever you wield a piercing weapon and use the cunning stance, add 4 to your attack roll. 

## Slashing
Slashing weapons use accuracy and dexterity to inflict damage, and therefore take the most advantage of high agility. Examples of slashing weapons include swords and scythes. Whenever you wield a slashing weapon and use the agility stance, add 4 to your attack rolls. 

## Special
Some weapons have multiple ways they can inflict damage, such as halberds. In this case, distribute three points of attack bonuses however you wish among the different stances.

# Armor
Armor works by increasing your defense rolls, making it harder for damage to get through to do you harm. Armor, as with other clothing, does not require equipment slots while wearing it.

## Heavy Armor
Add 6 to your defense rolls. Your move speed decreases by 30 feet.

## Medium Armor
Add 4 to your defense rolls. Your move speed decreases by 20 feet.

## Light Armor
Add 2 to your defense rolls. Your move speed decreases by 10 feet.

## No Armor
No effect

# Shields
You must have free hands available to wield a shield (e.g. Wielding a light melee weapon in the other hand). Shields can only be used in conjunction with light weapons. Shields require equipment slots regardless of if they are equipped or not.

## Heavy Shields
Add 2 to your defense rolls. Your move speed decreases by 10 feet.
Additionally, you may treat your space as a wall for talents and abilities that refer to adjacent walls.
Heavy shields require 10 equipment slots.

## Light Shields
Add 1 to your defense rolls. Your move speed decreases by 5 feet.
Light shields require 5 equipment slots.
