# Carrying Your Gear
People generally can’t pack more than 20% of their body weight on their backs, meaning that the average person can’t carry more than 30 pounds over long distances without some sort of pack animal. There are reasons people had horses and donkeys and other pack animals ages ago. You will likely want one too.
Whenever you pack up to leave for somewhere, you will have to declare how much gear you want to take. You will not, however, have to declare what you are specifically bringing. 
The amount of gear you bring is measured in levels, where each level grants you 10 slots of space and 1 level of burden. As you travel, whenever you want something that you think would make sense to have in your bag, instead you will cross off some of the slots and you may now add that item to your inventory. If the item you want to procure costs more slots than you have left, then it means you didn’t bring that item. 

# Encumbrance Score
There are several critical points of burden. Your first critical point of carrying capacity is your encumbrance score. This is equal to 10 times half your might die, and it dictates the maximum number of slots you can carry without any penalty. Once you surpass that amount, however, you become encumbered. While encumbered, for every 10 slots over your encumbrance score, you must choose to take a level of disadvantage on all athletics, stamina, and combat checks, or lose 10 feet of movement. You may reallocate penalties only once each day, when you first pick up your pack.

# Maximum Carrying Capacity
Your second critical point of burden is your maximum carrying capacity. This is equal to your might die times 10. You cannot spend long periods of time carrying this amount of weight. Carrying this amount of weight over short distances would require a might check as determined by the GM.
